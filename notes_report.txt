qc

- quality of the reads
- duplication of the reads
- Overrepresented sequences (seq that might have a lot of adapters left in it, or rRNA or contaminant (easy to trim out))
- GC content (most of the species peak around 50, but as long as you don't see crazy peaks coming out it's ok) (not sufficient to discard read if it does not impact the analysis downstream)

why is it impotant to know how many reads we sequenced?
- make sure there are not crazy different number of reads between samples 
- check the proportion of align reads over overall reads


MAPPING STEP

check on IGV:
exons
check strandness of the reads

we're still missing a score of the expression of the gene, we just have info on if a read matches and where.



Find uniquely concordantly mapped -> 
e.g., 97% overall alignment rate /data/users/iambrogetti/RNA-seq/data/sam/SRR7821918_summary.txt


Step 4
take gtf file (directions of the exons on the genome)
use it to understand how many reads align to each gene
